# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and other Python libraries in the Hospitality domain

## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a booking dataset using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset contains detailed information on customer bookings,
cancellations, destinations, and revenue, offering valuable insights into trends, customer behavior, and business performance. By analyzing the data, the project aims to uncover patterns that 
can inform decision-making and optimize business operations.

The analysis covers various aspects, including booking trends, customer segmentation, cancellation rates, revenue analysis, and pricing optimization. This project is part of a larger 
effort to apply data-driven techniques to solve real-world business problems in the travel and hospitality industry.
